    <h1>Charting Project by Samantha Perry</h1>

    <div class="row">
      <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 5% 10% 5% 10%;">Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks are off to their best start yet, but the team continues to fall short
        in several aspects. Wilson has established himself as an MVP candidate, but the 'Hawks still put more pointa on the board
        when they pound the ball with their star running back, Chris Carson. The team has also struggled to get going in the third
        quarter and turnovers have given their opponents unnecessary advantage.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 0% 10% 5% 10%;">These charts analyze the preformance of the Seahawks in their first five games
        of the season.</p>
      <h2>Effect of rushing yards on total points scored</h2>
      <p style="margin: 5% 10% 5% 10%;">The Seahawks have struggled to find their run game since the departure of Marshawn Lynch
      but Chris Carson has finally found his footing. It is fancinating to see that the total points scored follows the total rushing
    yards rather than passing. Even though Russell Wilson has put on an MVP preformance so far this year, it is clear they need to
  keep feeding Carson the ball.</p>
      <div id="offensive-yards" class="chart col-md-12"></div>
      <h2>Total offensive yards compared to penalty yards</h2>
      <p style="margin: 5% 10% 5% 10%;">The Seahawks have been struggling after the first half. After coming out of the locker room, Seattle
      has had both fewer yards of offense and more yards lost to penalties. </p>
      <div id="penalty" class="chart col-md-12" ></div>
      <h2>Drive outcome</h2>
      <p style="margin: 5% 10% 5% 10%;">Seattle has notoriously short drives and is currently ranked 32nd in time of possession. Most drives end with a punt, but
      several high-scoring games have improved the ratio. Unforetunately, the turnover rate for the 'Hawks is also very notable, with both RB Chris Carson and WR Jaron
    Brown dealing with some fumble issues.  </p>
